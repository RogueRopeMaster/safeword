## Arrival and Departure

Entrance to the event starts at 9 p.m. From midnight onwards, we assume everyone has arrived, and no further entries are allowed. The event ends at 3 a.m.

A list has been made of all participants. There's no need to print your ticket, but bring it with you on your phone.

The organizers cannot guarantee a refund if they are informed less than 48 hours before the event. Read more on the terms of sale here.

## Faithful Friends System

Every attendee has one or two Faithful Friends (hereafter "FF") to be able to attend our events.

Members of an FF group must arrive at the event together. Each member of an FF group is responsible for the others: if one FF is penalized, expelled, etc., the entire group faces the same consequences.

You are responsible for your FFs, and they are responsible for you.

There's no need to stay with your FF group throughout the event, although it might be helpful to keep a watchful eye on them. Everyone can leave whenever they decide. Once you exit, there's no re-entry.

## Respect for Others

The event is LGBTIQ+ friendly. Intolerance or any racist, xenophobic, homophobic, or transphobic behaviors are not accepted.

Kink-shaming is also not tolerated. Everyone is free to practice as they please with consenting partners.

Avoid making assumptions or judgments about participants' genders, orientations, or sexual practices. Feel free to politely ask for someone's pronouns.

Don't share personal information about a third party without their permission. Many of us prefer to remain discreet.

Obtain and give clear consent for everything you do. Whether it's kissing, touching, spanking, licking, etc., consent must be given and confirmed for each new action and can be withdrawn at any time.

Be respectful in your interactions with others. If someone doesn't show explicit interest, don't push.

Voyeurs, be smart. Don't disturb the participants of a scene and avoid crowding.

Don't ask for permission to watch a scene; it can be disruptive. Stay at a safe distance so as not to physically disturb those involved.

Regardless of the ongoing activity, outsiders are by default asked not to interfere or disrupt the play or aftercare. Any technical questions, requests for information, or even simple comments should wait until the play and aftercare are finished.

## Respect for the Venue

Candle usage is only allowed in designated areas and with proper precautions (alerted Dungeon Keepers, floor mats, cleaning, etc.).

No fluids or messy activities on the sofas and benches.

Smoking is only permitted in the smoking area. We ask that e-cigarettes be used in the lobby for everyone's comfort.

There's no locker room with lockable lockers, so don't leave valuables. We can't ensure the safety of your belongings.

## Two Floors, Two Vibes

You'll be greeted by the organizers who will check that you're accompanied by your FF and have read the rules and signed the waiver.

Once done, you're invited to the main hall with its chat corner and dungeon space.

Through a large archway, you can already glimpse some mattresses in a darker room to tantalize all your senses. These two rooms will be lively, perfect for raucous and noisy play.

Next is the play hard space (for games that might be unsettling to some: needles, sounds, blood play).

Ensure you have all necessary equipment before starting. No lending of sterile equipment or disinfectants will be done.

We assume if you engage in a practice, you have the required knowledge and tools, from knowing the risk areas to having a rope cutter.

The first floor follows, separated by a landing with toilets and a window to the smoking area.

There's a shower room where you can change.

The cocoon room with its soft mats awaits your gentler games.

Next to it is the kitchen, serving as an off-game zone to chat without disturbing the more active players.

## Safety of All

Upon entering the event, you'll sign a liability waiver.

In case of injury or accident due to your actions, you'll be held responsible.

The OUAK, Safeword ASBL, and the organizing team provide a venue and cannot be held responsible for how you use it.

Several individuals, the Dungeon Keepers, identifiable by a glowing necklace, are there to ensure your safety and well-being. They'll guide you around if needed, handle complaints, and assist in cases of aggression (physical or psychological).

During their shift (when they wear the glowing necklace), they're not allowed to engage intimately with other participants.

Outside their shift, they shouldn't interact with those they don't know, to avoid authority biases.

Inform Dungeon Keepers before using candles or starting a "hard" play scene.

The safeword for the evening is "red." Anyone can use it to stop an action that goes too far.

If you hear the safeword but the person doesn't stop, everyone nearby is responsible for intervening. If that fails, find a Dungeon Keeper.

For safety reasons, games that restrict breathing to the point of fainting are strictly prohibited.

However, breathplay with hands to restrict blood flow is acceptable.

For hygiene reasons, playing under the shower is also off-limits.

No drugs at our event. Disobeying this rule will get you escorted out.

## Equipment

Various tools will be set up for your games. Please respect them and ensure they remain in good condition.

For personal equipment (whips, floggers, paddles, needles, ropes...), we don't provide them, so bring your own.

If you lend to others, it's your responsibility. Respect what's lent to you.

## Food and Drinks

Drinks are included in your ticket and are unlimited.

A bar offers soft drinks and light alcohols.

If the team thinks you've drunk too much, you'll be asked to wait before playing.

If you're drunk, your FF will kindly escort you home.

Food should mostly remain in the bar and buffet area.

Be careful where you place your drinks. Play setups aren't bar counters, and don't leave drinks on the floor.

## Photos and Phone Use

For obvious discretion and confidentiality reasons, mobile phones and cameras are strictly prohibited.

No photographers on-site.

We hope to have some in the future to help you keep good memories.

## Sanctions

In case of violation of these rules, the organizing team reserves the right to exclude the participant and their Faithful Friends group from the current and future events.

If this occurs, tickets will not be refunded.
