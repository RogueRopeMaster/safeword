Our tickets usually sell out in just a few minutes.

At that point, getting in can feel like a game of luck.

One big reason is simple: each event depends on 18 volunteer shifts that need to be filled.

To keep this running, volunteers get a discount and can bring up to two friends.

If you want to make sure you have a spot:

- Become a volunteer.
- Get a discount.
- Make two friends very happy.

Here is a quick overview of the shifts:

- Dungeon Keepers: safety, consent checks, and incident response in play spaces.
- Shibari Keepers: rope safety oversight and calm space support.
- Buffet Volunteers: keep food and drinks stocked, clean, and welcoming.
- Assemblers: set up the venue before doors open.
- Disassemblers: restore the venue after the event.
- Food Prep: prepare buffet food before opening.
- Roadies: load and unload equipment during daytime logistics.
