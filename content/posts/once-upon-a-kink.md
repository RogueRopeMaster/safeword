Once Upon a Kink is a kinky party focused on interactions and plays. It's an event where people can express themselves.

Please, respect your fellow kinksters and keep in mind that the party is LGBT-friendly. Intolerance and racism will be banned with no regrets.

In a comfy and cosy atmosphere, you will find two rooms with two different moods. A calm space where cuddles and shibari will reign and a space for noisier and dirtier play (and we know how naughty you like to be).

## LOCATION

The event is hosted in the Boxon/Alternee. Doors will be open from 9pm to 11pm. After that, all entry will be refused. The event closes at 3am.

The address will be provided with the confirmation of your entry in the guest list by mail.

## FAITHFUL FRIENDS

Also, we ask you to find one or two faithful friends. The price is really cheap, there is no cooptation system, and the event is open to new people.

So in order to keep the environment as safe as possible, we ask you to keep an eye on each other. If one person is asked by the staff to leave the party, their pair or trio will follow (and depending on the inconvenience, may potentially be blacklisted).

You can enter the party when your group is present at the door and not before. You can leave whenever you want.

## DRESSCODE

The night is ours... well beyond midnight. There will be no limit to your imagination.

We know that black leather and latex isn't for every wallet or taste, and we would be pained to know that it could restrain you from expressing yourself.

Even if there is no so-called dress code, we would love to see you dressed in your kinky fantasies. There will be a space to change outfits but no lockers, so please be farsighted.

## DRINKS

One of our first goals is to create an event with a democratic price. With that point in mind, we decided to put the entry at 35 euros.

In that price is included access to a buffet and drinks. As the event is focused on play, we will not serve any spirits, but soft drinks and a little bit of wine and beer.

Included, we prepared for you a beautiful eco cup.
