Dear Volunteers,

Thanks for offering to help with *Once Upon a Kink*. This section gives a quick overview of the volunteer roles and what each one involves.

Our tickets usually sell out in just a few minutes, so getting in can feel like a game of luck.

Each edition depends on 18 volunteer shifts that need to be filled.

Volunteers get a discount and can bring up to two friends.

 Pick a role below and read the briefing before you sign up:

1. [**Dungeon Keepers**](dungeon-keepers/) — Safety-focused role overseeing play spaces, consent rules, and incident response.
2. [**Shibari Keepers**](shibari-keepers/) — Focused on rope safety, calm space management, and respectful use of the garden area.
3. [**Buffet Volunteers**](buffet-volunteers/) — Keep the buffet stocked, clean, and welcoming throughout the night.
4. [**Assemblers**](assemblers/) — Set up the venue before opening.
5. [**Disassemblers**](disassemblers/) — Restore the venue after close.
6. [**Food Prep**](food-prep/) — Prepare food before doors open so the buffet can run smoothly.
7. [**Roadies**](roadies/) — Help load and unload the truck and move boxes (daytime, usually around noon).

Volunteering is one of the best ways to secure your spot.

If your role takes place during the event, please arrive 15 minutes before the start of your shift so we can do a quick handover.

In the weeks before the event, volunteers will receive an invite to join the WhatsApp group for updates and coordination.

Not sure which role fits you best, or have questions? Reach out via the [contact page](../contact/).

With thanks,

*Once Upon a Kink*
