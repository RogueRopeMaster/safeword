## The Garden

The DK or Dungeon Keepers are supervisors of a kinky event. They are responsible for the safety and help to create a safer atmosphere. They makes sure our rules are followed too.

You have been assigned specific time for your shift.
If you start at 21pm, please be there at the right time.
If you do one of the later shifts try to talk with your previous co-volunteer right before. If your next co-volunteer finishes a play or needs to pee, please be flexible and do not run after them.

You will be equipped with a red light necklace.
If the collar is discharged, replace it (entrance kitchen) and put the old one to charge.
A space is allocated to you but you are not confined to it. Do not hesitate to go through the corridors and rooms not dedicated. Since playing is not allowed in those spaces, you can remind forgetful attendees.
The most important thing is to remain visible and available.

Do not sit in an armchair and spend the entire shift chatting to your friends while watching uncarefully. People would think that you don't want be disturbed.
In the other direction, don't turn into a Welsh guard. Feel free to drink, chat and sit down.
Just avoid extremes.
Of course, don't play with your partner during your shift.

If something happens during your shift and you need help, communicate with your pair and let them and the organizator know what's happening.
A boudoir space is available only in the event that a person needs to be isolated after an incident. This is located at the end of the entrance hall.

At the end of your shift, debrief with the DK who comes after you. Communicate incidents and especially if there are people to keep an eye on.
If a person should be put out of the party (Danger to others, breach of consent, drunkenness, prohibited practice), do not do it yourself. Ask someone from the organization to take over. (Ambre, Ambroise, Hansf, Augustine, Doodler, Eldey).

The main point of DK's work, in addition to a reassuring presence and a displayed availability, is to monitor. Overall you can ask yourself if:

- Do people look comfortable?
- Is everything looking under control? (no candle near a curtain, glass or gear lying in the wrong place, does the top always have the bottom in sight, does the bottom bleed without the knowledge of the top? In those case -> react!)
- Does someone need help?

## The Different Areas

There are two play areas.

The "Dungeon" area: On the ground floor, directly on the right as you enter.
This area is for impact, sex, and all other loud Bdsm play.
If there is a triggering play (within our rules) please redirect it to the Hard room.

The "Garden" area: Upstairs. This room is for shibari, cuddles, sex, and other Bdsm plays that are somewhat quiet. It is a room that is adjacent to homes.

Spaces where play is not allowed:
Play is not allowed in any other area. Buffet, hallways, stairs, smoking room, toilets, shower room and the second floor kitchen.

## Hard-Play

We consider "Hard", the plays that can trigger participants (blood, needles, urethral play, ...) These must be directed to the "Hard room" (Dungeon's end).
No "waterplay" (uro) is allowed.

## Breathplay

Keep an eye out for people who would practice breathing games (only the ones made with hands are authorized). Be prepared to react in case of an incident. Choking/blocking blood until fainting is prohibited.

## Fire and Candles

Games with fire (flammable gel) are prohibited.

Candle play can be done in both play areas. We do not provide the candles, people should have their own. Give an oilcloth for the people who practice them in order to receive the wax. Also, place a damp towel near the area in case there is a burn or if hair catches fire.
An oilcloth and a wet towel are available on each floor (ground floor: near the door, upstairs: near the mirror). After the play, ask people to carefully fold the blanket and shake it over a garbage can. If the towel has been used, please replace it.

As the floor is full of carpets, it's really important to keep a mindful eye on the scene.

## Impact

As the room is dedicated to calmer activities, no loud, repeated impact can take place here. Some slaps are okay if the people around don't mind it, but if people start to do a big spanking session, please redirect them to the impact room.

## Safeword

If you hear a safeword, make sure it is respected. Check that the person does not need assistance. In case the person seems to need it, take some time to chat with them and take them to the boudoir area.
Red/Rouge is the universal safeword of the evening. It cannot be ignored and the game must stop instantly.

## Shibari

If you are a DK here it's because we consider that you have some knowledge of the matter. You'll see advanced folks who do ropes every week as well as beginners. Watch if people respect each others' space (no rope knots should reach other participants). Look if both participants are checking for nerve damage (thumbup, open and close the hand). None (half)suspension should be done without particular attention. Let them know if what they are doing is dangerous without stressing the bottom much. If the bottom is already panicking, help them to end the session as fast as possible.
A rope scissor is available on the table next to the mirror.
No neck rope (even for experimented riggers, we wouldn't like novice copycats!).

## Sex

Sex can take place in the Garden with proper planning: since the floor is full of carpets, people have to use a purple towel. And after the act they should put it in the laundry bin.

## Safespace

It's the kitchen next to the garden, people can talk freely in here since it's a non play zone.
If a group of people talks lively in the playroom while others are calmly playing and starting to get bothered, you should check if the safespace is free and let the talkative group know they should continue their stories there. If the safespace is already occupied, then, just ask them to talk softly in regards to the other. You should check this room a few times during your shift to make sure everything is fine.

## Contact

If you have a problem or a question, Ambroise is the referent person of the Dungeon Keepers team. Do not hesitate to head to her. (If she is playing and it is eminently necessary for her to intervene, draw her attention or her partner's attention to the fact that you need her.)
