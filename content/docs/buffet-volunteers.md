## Briefing

The Buffet volunteers are responsible for the good keeping of the buffet.

We need you to keep an eye on food and drinks to check if something have to be refilled and also if someone is searching for something or possibly making a mess.
People will serve themselves foods and drinks, but if you see that they were playing just before, please ask them to disinfect and/or clean their hands before touching the buffet or if they ask it, you can help them and do it.
Try to keep the area clean. The trash cans are near the stairs.

You have been assigned specific times for your shifts. Of course, punctuality will always be appreciated.

If you are the first one (21-23) please be there right on time, or even a few minutes before.
If you are followed by someone who just finished a play, or needs to go pee, do not run after them.
If you follow someone, talk to them and ask about what needs to be done just before they end their shift.

## Drinks

We have: Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Fanta, Fanta Zero, Ice Tea Peach, Ice Tea Green, Still Water, Sparkling water, Beer, Red wine, White wine.

To avoid waste, try to have only one bottle of each kind open.
The unopened bottles of each drinks can be found under the table.
Still water and wines will be in cube boxes.

Ice cubes will be accessible in a cooler next to the buffet.

## Food

Everything on the buffet is at least Veggie, and some are Vegan or Gluten free (it's listed on the little signs).

There are some snacks: peanuts, chips, fruits, waffles, cheese, cherry tomatoes. You only have to check if there are enough of them, spare ones can be found under the table.

In the fridge you can find:

- 1 Pissaladiere
- 4 Margarita pizza
- 4 Formagi pizza
- 3 Pumpkin Quiches
- 3 Mushroom Quiches

Your job is to always have one ready on the buffet table.

The pizzas are fresh, and quiches pre-cooked.
Cook the pizza in the oven for at least 12 minutes at the max heat.
For the quiches, heat them for 10 minutes (be careful not to burn them).
Then slice it in the kitchen and serve in the plates.
Put them next to the right sign.

You can slice the pizzas in the traditional way (8 slices) and the quiches in 5 cm squares.

## Desserts

## Checklist

1. Check bowls on the table. Is the food running low? Refill if needed. Is everything still looking fresh and appetizing?
