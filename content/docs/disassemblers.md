## Disassembling

Here are some of the tasks that you will be asked to accomplish in order to guarantee the smooth running of the disassembly.

If anything is unclear, the lead (Ambre) will be there to guide you. Please ask if you need more information.

I'll describe every room, what needs to be cleaned and where to put it.

Thank you for helping us to make the Ouak come true.
