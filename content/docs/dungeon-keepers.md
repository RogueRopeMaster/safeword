## The Dungeon

The Dungeon Keepers (DKs) are supervisors of a kinky event. They are responsible for safety and help to create a safer atmosphere. They make sure our rules are followed too.

You have been assigned a specific time for your shift.
If you start at 21:00, please be there on time.
If you do one of the later shifts, try to talk with your previous co-volunteer right before. If your next co-volunteer finishes a play or needs to pee, please be flexible and do not run after them.

You will be equipped with a red light necklace.
If the collar is discharged, replace it (entrance kitchen) and put the old one on charge.
A space is allocated to you, but you are not confined to it. Do not hesitate to go through the corridors and rooms not dedicated to play. Since playing is not allowed in those spaces, you can remind forgetful attendees.
The most important thing is to remain visible and available.

Do not sit in an armchair and spend the entire shift chatting to your friends while watching inattentively. People would think that you don't want to be disturbed.
On the other hand, don't turn into a Welsh Guard. Feel free to drink, chat, and sit down.
Of course, don't play with your partner during your shift.
Just avoid extremes.

If something happens during your shift and you need help, communicate with your pair and let them and the organizer know what's happening.
A boudoir space is available only in the event that a person needs to be isolated after an incident. This is located at the end of the entrance hall.

At the end of your shift, debrief with the DK who comes after you. Communicate incidents and especially if there are people to keep an eye on.
If a person needs to be put out of the party (danger to others, breach of consent, drunkenness, prohibited practice), do not do it yourself. Ask someone from the organization to take over. (Ambre, Ambroise, Hansf, Augustine, Doodler, Eldey).

The main point of DK's work, in addition to a reassuring presence and a displayed availability, is to monitor. Overall you can ask yourself if:

- Do people look comfortable?
- Is everything looking under control? (no candle near a curtain, glass or gear lying in the wrong place, does the top always have the bottom in sight, does the bottom bleed without the knowledge of the top? In those cases -> react!)
- Does someone need help?

## The Different Areas

There are two play areas.

The "Dungeon" area: On the ground floor, directly on the right as you enter.
This area is for impact, sex, and all other BDSM play.
If there is a triggering play (within our rules), please redirect it to the Hard room.

The "Garden" area: Upstairs. This room is for shibari, cuddles, sex, and other BDSM plays that are somewhat quiet.
This room is adjacent to homes.

Spaces where play is not allowed:
Play is not allowed in any other area: buffet, hallways, stairs, smoking room, toilets, shower room, and the second-floor kitchen.

## Hard-Play

We consider "Hard" plays to be those that can trigger participants (blood, needles, urethral play, ...). These must be directed to the "Hard room" (Dungeon's end).
No "waterplay" (uro) is allowed.

If people start these kinds of practices, do not hesitate to ask if they have all the necessary equipment (disinfectant, etc.).

## Breathplay

Keep an eye out for people who practice breathing games (only the ones done with hands are authorized). Be prepared to react in case of an incident. Choking/blocking blood until fainting is prohibited.

## Sex

Sex can take place in the dungeon almost everywhere, but remind forgetful attendees if they leave their crime scene without proper cleaning. There's disinfectant (black bottle spray) and paper towels in every room. They should of course put that in the trash bin afterwards.

## Fire and Candles

Games with fire (flammable gel) are prohibited.

Candle play can be done in both play areas. We do not provide the candles; people should have their own. Give an oilcloth to the people who practice it in order to catch the wax. Also, place a damp towel near the area in case there is a burn or if hair catches fire.
An oilcloth and a wet towel are available on each floor (ground floor: near the door, upstairs: near the mirror). After the play, ask people to carefully fold the blanket and shake it over a garbage can. If the towel has been used, please replace it.

## Impact

Here is a diagram of the risk areas. This diagram is not perfect because it does not take into account the type of impact, but it gives a good indication. A light impact (the cracker of a whip, for example) may be received on the stomach and lower back, for example.

## Safeword

If you hear a safeword, make sure it is respected. Check that the person does not need assistance. If the person seems to need it, take some time to chat with them and take them to the boudoir area.
Red/Rouge is the universal safeword of the evening. It cannot be ignored and the game must stop instantly.

## Contact

If you have a problem or a question, Ambroise is the reference person for the Dungeon Keepers team. Do not hesitate to head to Ambroise. (If Ambroise is playing and it is urgently necessary to intervene, draw Ambroise's attention or the attention of Ambroise's partner to the fact that you need help.)
