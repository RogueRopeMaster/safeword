## Assembling

Here are some of the tasks that you will be asked to accomplish in order to guarantee the smooth running of the assembly.

I may not think of everything, so, of course, I (Ambre) will be there to guide you through it all. Don't hesitate to ask for further information.

I'll describe every room, what needs to go in it and where to find it.

Thank you for helping us to make the Ouak come true.
