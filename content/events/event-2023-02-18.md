> A murmur, a rumor runs through the forest. The neighborhood whispers to who wants to hear. “A great party will happen on the 18th February. Spirits and bodies will rejoice. Vices and delights will blend. Don’t forget your toys and your naughty tools. Be prepared to leave with lots of memories, maybe marks and bruises if you are lucky.” https://fetlife.com/events/1215104
