# About Safeword

About
At the beginning, there was a simple idea. In the cold night of Brussels, starting a little fire where people could bring their crazy thoughts and share with everyone all their kinky dreams.
With each person, each log of wood, the fire would be bigger, warmer. With the participation of everyone, this spark-born would become a place where everyone would feel welcome and comfortable to show how kinky they can be.

Safeword is a non-profit organization. Its goal is principally to create events and help everyone to create their own. Each event created or helped by Safeword will participate in raising awareness in sexuality, kinky universe and consent. This is one of the main purposes of the organization.

And to end with good news, a party is in creation soâ€¦ stay tuned !
