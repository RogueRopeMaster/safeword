# About Safeword

At the beginning, there was a simple idea. On a cold night in Brussels, a little fire was lit—something warm and wild, where people could gather, bring their craziest thoughts, and share their kinkiest dreams. With each person, each log of wood added, the fire grew—bigger, brighter, and bolder. Through everyone's presence and participation, that small spark became a space where people felt welcome and safe to explore and express how kinky they truly are.

Safeword is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating events—and supporting others in creating their own—that foster awareness around sexuality, kink, and consent. That mission remains at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve now hosted over ten parties and we’re still going strong. A few years in, even more ideas and concepts are brewing. Stay tuned.
