### Join the Safeword Crew âœ¨

Want to be part of the magic from the inside?  
Safeword wouldnâ€™t exist without its community â€” and itâ€™s volunteers like you who make it all happen.

Weâ€™re looking for enthusiastic folks to help out during our events.  
Whether youâ€™d like to:  
- assist at the buffet,  
- help set up and tear down (roadie vibes welcome),  
- or serve as a caring, attentive dungeon monitor,  

â€¦thereâ€™s a spot for you on the team.

ðŸ’Œ Interested? Reach out to **contact@safeword.be**  
Weâ€™d love to hear from you.
