## Join the Safeword Crew

Want to be part of the magic from the inside?

Safeword runs thanks to its community, and volunteers are at the heart of every edition.

Our tickets usually sell out in just a few minutes, so getting in can feel like a game of luck.

Each event depends on 18 volunteer shifts that need to be filled.

Volunteers get a discount and can bring up to two friends.

Our total capacity is 75. You can do the math.

## Shift Overview

- Dungeon Keepers: safety, consent checks, and incident response in play spaces.
- Shibari Keepers: rope safety oversight and calm space support.
- Buffet Volunteers: keep food and drinks stocked, clean, and welcoming.
- Assemblers: set up the venue before doors open.
- Disassemblers: restore the venue after the event.
- Food Prep: prepare buffet food before opening.
- Roadies: load and unload equipment during daytime logistics.

If your role takes place during the event, please arrive 15 minutes before your shift for handover.

In the weeks before the event, volunteers receive an invite to the WhatsApp group for updates and coordination.
